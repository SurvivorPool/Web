## What is Survivorpool?

Survivorpool is an American Football pool where you can choose 1 NFL team each week to advance onto the next week. If your chosen team loses, you're out of the game. The game continues until there's a single survivor or the season ends.


## Getting Started

Ensure you have an `.env.local` in the root of the project

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The app will open to localhost:3000
